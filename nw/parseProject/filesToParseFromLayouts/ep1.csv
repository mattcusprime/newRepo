Episode One,Key,Value,Order
balor1,"Balor:Did someone say powerfully pedantic?",1
balor2,"Balor:Don't answer that.",2
balor2.1,"Balor: 'He said pedantically.'",3
balor2.2,"Balor:Is what one of you should have said...amateurs.",4
balor3,"Balor:I verify the accuracy of this story. Continue.",5
balor4,"Balor:HAHAHA! I'm laughing because what you said is painful! Painful because you don't have something that is awesome! HA! Good stuff.",6
bgSide1,"Boethius:Welcome sir. I have scouted the town of Heahill as you requested.",7
bgSide2,"Boethius:Yes sir! Their insolence will come to an end. We will fall on them like a thing with high mass falling on a thing with very little structural integrity!!!",8
bgSide3,"Boethius:Yeah! They will be like a thing that is significantly less potent and less fast! They will be so amazed by the other thing, which is us, that they will be in an awe inspired coma!",9
bgSide4,"Boethius:Of course sir. Simile is exactly like a metaphor. Better said, it is where you take the situation at hand and restate the exact same thing using difficult to understand words.",10
bgSide4.1,"Boethius:It's like when you say something in a cave and the cave echoes it back. You could say that cave is 'metaphoring' you with a simile.",11
bgSide5,"Boethius:Nailed it.",12
drox1,"Drox:Fiend, the purpose of strength is to show mercy; and yet to you it is its own end. Like a child you cannot see beyond the thing itself to its purpose. You are...limited.",13
drox2,"Drox:An astute summary. I wonder how you never picked up on the magic thing before.",14
grey1,"Dark Hood:The town of Heahill. It's people are weak and overwhelmed with distraction...We will fall on them like a bird on its prey.",15
grey2,"Dark Hood:They will be like a flower that is so mesmerized by the feeding hummingbird that it cannot move for fear that it will disrupt perfection.",16
grey3,"Dark Hood:Are you familiar with the concept of a simile?",17
grey4,"Dark Hood:You just...never mind...continue scouting...from here.",18
grey5,"Dark Hood:Actually it is, but he's really only gotten things started. Allow me. ",19
grey5.1,"Dark Hood:Fuge hiuuxa y'est gei",20
grey6,"Dark Hood:The mother as well? Cute. I'm taking the child...where is the child?",21
grey7,"You know me?? Interesting. No matter, if you are as powerful as you are pedantic then I've stumbled on true potential.",22
grey8,"Dark Hood:Arrogance, how common. But three adepts in the same household, that's beyond coincidence. The father seems bewildered though, is he without powers? Improbable...",23
grey9,"Dark Hood:Improbable...I detest surprises. I'll be back for the boy when the time is right.",24
lucca1,"Lucca:....",25
lucca2,"Lucca:Buwi adayahee fiece iweb qaei.",26
mallurian1,"Mallurian:He's here. *Click anywhere on the screen or press spacebar to progress dialog*",28
mallurian10,"Mallurian:That's what the cleric said too. Anyway, he had left me a note with only a few words on it. His dying words, which are of course well known to be the most true words one says, were: ",29
mallurian10.1,"Mallurian:'The water lillies are the lyingest of all flowers.' Deep stuff. Anyway, what were you saying?",30
mallurian11,"Mallurian:He's a pragmatic.",31
mallurian12,"Mallurian:So before, he was talking about himself.",32
mallurian13,"Mallurian:I think...I think he doesn't appreciate waiting.",33
mallurian14,"Mallurian:Sorry! I'm nervous and I mean who refers to themselves in the third person? That shouldn't even be a thing.",34
mallurian15,"Mallurian:He struggles with words.",35
mallurian16,"Mallurian:Sen how did you just? Where is? Drox, is that you over there? Where the heck did you come from?",36
mallurian17,"Mallurian:Honestly I am as surprised as you. I'm kind of just taking it all in. ?I mean, wow.",37
mallurian19,"Mallurian:I also hate surprises, but lack the abiltiy to dematerialize. It takes a lot of the weight out of the announcement.",38
mallurian19.05," Mallurian:So the prag guy looking for magic, something that is considered gone from the realm, comes by and not only does he find it but he finds...a lot. ",39
mallurian19."Mallurian:Then the hooded guy materializes and tries to take our son, I guess cause of the magic thing?",40
mallurian2,"Mallurian:ok...",41
mallurian20,"Mallurian:We see what we want to see I guess. This is overwhelming... whatever... wish I had magic.",42
mallurian3,"Mallurian:so",43
mallurian4,"Mallurian:is",44
mallurian5,"Mallurian:now?",45
mallurian6,"Mallurian:So,if I'm supposed to quit being so literal is a couple of minutes actually an hour or?",46
mallurian7,"Mallurian:Wow,that was awesome.",47
mallurian7.1,"Mallurian:Wait,what do you mean 'none of it's ever going to happen'? I don't have any say in the thing? ",48
mallurian8,"Mallurian:That's pretty wild. I guess that closes that issue. Real quick though, wanted to tell you a fully unrelated story. Not sure if you knew, but my father was a powerful florist.",49
mallurian9,"Mallurian:Well, he did flowering for years. Like a ton of years. Unfortunately, in his later years the flowering business got pretty tough.",50
mallurian9.1,"Mallurian:He was killed in a freak flower accident murder. The sick bastards left half cut red flowers on his pillow as a message.",51
prag1,"Prag:The pragmatics do not appreciate waiting.",52
prag2,"Prag:No, that's alright. Call the child in now please.",53
prag3,"Prag:So I'll place the artifact on the table and we'll see if it reacts. I've never actually seen one do anything and I've done about a thousand of these.",54
prag4,"Prag:Some people have said they have seen some cause it to emit a small luminescence, but I suspect that is wishful thinking. Magic is dead, if it ever existed at all.",55
prag5,"Prag:Hello there boy. Will you play a quick game with me?",56
prag6,"Prag:Does he not talk?",57
prag7,"Prag:Whatever, I have 10 more of these to do this morning.",58
prag8,"Prag:As usual...nothing. I'll be on my way.",59
prag9,"Prag:What in the...that's not possible.",60
senenle1,"Sen:Ok...I'm coming in. Just give me another second.",61
senenle10,"Sen:If anyone is listening out there,please help us keep our secret. Also,while I have you,why do they sell potion bottles in sets of 6 but they only sell you enough potion to fill 4? ",62
senenle1"Sen:Better get to the house. Only building in town, other than the church, with a stain glass window. Classin it up as usual.",63
senenle12,"Sen:I figured.",64
senenle13,"Sen:I know.",65
senenle14,"Sen:I KNOW.",66
senenle15,"Sen:Sorry about that. I wanted to give you time to settle in? Can I get you some tea?",67
senenle16,"Sen:Of course.",68
senenle17,"Sen:Sweetheart, come in here. ? So what exactly are you going to do?",69
senenle18,"Sen:Yeah that's pretty accurate...Sorry.",70
senenle2,"Sen:Quit being so literal and give me a couple minutes!",71
senenle3,"Sen:JUST GO!",72
senenle4,"Sen:What a goof,my goof,but definitely a goof. Same as it was 8 years ago... today!? I remember when we first started toying with the idea.",73
senenle5,"Sen:So,that's my best bride impersonation. Was fun to do that,even though none of this is going to happen of course.",74
senenle6,"Sen:I went to the temple last night and prayed over the waters. As I was praying the water lillies moved into an odd formation.",75
senenle7,"Sen:As I looked closer I saw they had spelled out 'he is too weird'.",76
senenle7."Sen:While I am not incredibly supersitious, some signs just have to be heeded.",77
senenle8,"Sen:Powerful. Uncommon adjective for a florist. I'll allow it, go on. Just keep in mind I've met him like 6 times.",78
senenle9,"Sen:Wait, cut roses would be a pretty standard condolence. I'm pretty sure it was just a standard flower 'sorry for your loss' kind of thing.",79
senenleSide1,"err, wrong house. I guess.",80
senenleSide2,"Third times a charm. Hehe",81
senenleSide3,"Ok, this is getting embarrassing...",82
senenleSide4,"Ugh, better keep looking.",83
senenleSide51,"If Mal were here he'd tell you that's not the proper use of literally. He literally would.",84
senDontLeaveTown,"Riveting stuff. I'd ask you more about it but... I'm afraid you'll answer",85
blackSmith1,"Blacksmith:Can I interest you in Iron Armor? 100G! Or Gold Armor? 1000G! Or, perhaps, DIAMOND ARMOR!! 100000G!!",86
senenleBlackSmith1,"Sen:You seem to have an exponential thing going on with your pricing scheme. Don't you think you should narrow in on a single demographic?",87
blackSmith2,"Blacksmith:What... do you mean?",88
senenleBlackSmith2,"Sen:You have 3 items for sale each of which appeal to an entirely different group of customers. I mean if you get lucky enough to sell some Iron Armor it's extremely unlikely that same person would buy an item 10x its price... or 1000x its price.",89
blackSmith3,"Blacksmith:All these years... I thought it was my personality. I tempered armor and swords, but never... my soul.",90
senenleBlackSmith3,"Sen: I just meant you should maybe change prices. Soul tempering is good too though.",91

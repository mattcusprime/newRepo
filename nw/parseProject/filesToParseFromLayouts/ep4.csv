Episode Four,Key,Value,Order 
Mallurian1,"How is it that all this time... you never told me that you could throw a fireball across a room?",1
Balor2,"err... Drox, I think this is about to get uncomfortable. ",2
Senenle3,"I tried! You were so thick you didn't even notice! that or you were so obsessed with whatever the shiny thing of the day was that you wouldn't stop talking.",3
Drox4,"I have had my shoulder blade cut by a broadsword and my shield arm mashed in, but this is about to be like that time I let Jess be my squire after we broke up.",4
Mallurian5,"Wow, that was like... a record. I think in the last two sentences you said the word ""I"" once and ""you"" four times you. Really owning it aren't you?",5
Balor6,"Oh man, I remember that. Every time she fitted you she asked at least 5 times if the codpiece was tight enough. I have a feeling it was. Hey, let's go check out the stain glass windows at the church.",6
Drox7,"Yeah well, let's just say it never fell off in battle. I had to get it resmithed after that. Why do you want to see those old windows, they haven't changed in 25 years? ",7
Balor8,"Yes... so let's... go... check them out. *WINK WINK*",8
Drox9,"Oh... check them out!! Right, we should. Definitely should.",9
Senenle10,"I did try Mal. Every time I tried it felt weird. I mean what do I even say to explain something that is happening to me that I don't even understand myself?",10
Mallurian11,"Something Sen. Not articulate or well thought out, but something. All the things we could've blown up together. Should've said something.",11
Senenle12,"I hardly see how saying the word 'something' would have helped.",12
Mallurian13,"What?",13
Senenle14,"C'mon. You can make stupid jokes about words and I can't?",14
Mallurian15,"Heh... I did kind of feel like it was my thing. I'm still pissed though. ",15
Mallurian16,"I mean, what do we do now? Just keep on keeping on? Who was that dude with the hood? Is there any other secret information you have about that that you should avail me of?",16
Senenle17,"Avail? You're such an ass. No, I don't; but he was after Lucca. I think we need to get out of town and send Lucca away with the Sage. He knows how to get him to a safe place. Then we need to figure out what's going on somehow.",17
Mallurian18,"Get out of town and send him away?! You must think I'm an ass cause that's a plan only an ass would agree with... No, we stay here and buckle down. We'll put some feelers out, but home is safe.",18
Senenle19,"Oh surprise, Mal wants to do the plan that requires the smallest amount of change possible. You're as stubborn as an ass on top of it.",19
Mallurian20,"HP and MP! Enough with the (admittedly fantastic) donkey analogies already! I'm out of here... need some peace.",20
Senenle21,"Mal... ",21
Senenle22,"Sigh... ",22
Senenle23,"Toy on Floor: Lucca's blanket. I know these are just things, but they feel like so much more. Normalcy? Whatever it is, have to leave it behind.",23
Senenle24,"How... why?",24
Hench25,"Lady Callous how are we going to put out the fire if they give us Mal and the gold?",25
Callous26,"I said I'd keep burning more things if they don't bring them to me. That which is already aflame is simply the cost of doing business with us. ",26
Hench27,"Yes... I understand. It's just, some of the houses have children inside. Callous:...",27
Hench28,"My lady...? I can't see how they merit.",28
Callous29,"Help the children out, don't be seen...",29
Hench30,"Done",30
Hench 31,"disappears",31
Callous32,"Sigh.. that soft patch is gonna get me killed.",32
Callous33," BRING ME MALLURIAN.",33
Mallurian34,"What... Sen...",34
Mallurian35,"Sen! You were right! Let's get out of here!",35
Senenle36,"Ah, music to my ears, and all it took was mass arson.",36
Mallurian37,"Quick, over here, help me pull this board up.",37
Mallurian38,"Get inside!",38
Senenle39,"Sage Ralph! ",39
Mallurian40,"Bros!",40
Balor41,"Yup, we're all here in the place we agreed to go in case of an emergency... during an emergency. Admittedly a lot of people still don't do that but... hey!",41
Senenle42,"Sage... I need to ask you a favor. I need you to take Lucca and Cressa hide them away somewhere safe. At least until we find some answers as to what's going on and why... well, everything.",42
Drox43,"I'll take Balor and head to Anwick. It's a long ways but the Paladins will certainly have heard something. I still have friends there.",43
Balor44,"What do you mean 'take' Balor? ",44
Mallurian45,"We'll go to Kamaryen. Steve will still be there, I imagine he'll have read or heard something on the matter. ",45

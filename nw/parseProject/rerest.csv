1,drox1,"Drox:Fiend, the purpose of strength is to show mercy; and yet to you it is its own end. Like a child you cannot see beyond the thing itself to its purpose. You are...limited.",13
1,balor2.1,Balor: 'He said pedantically.',3
1,balor2.2,Balor:Is what one of you should have said...amateurs.,4
1,bgSide4,"Boethius:Of course sir. Simile is exactly like a metaphor. Better said, it is where you take the situation at hand and restate the exact same thing using difficult to understand words.",10
1,balor2,Balor:Don't answer that.,2
1,bgSide3,"Boethius:Yeah! They will be like a thing that is significantly less potent and less fast! They will be so amazed by the other thing, which is us, that they will be in an awe inspired coma!",9
1,bgSide5,Boethius:Nailed it.,12
1,balor3,Balor:I verify the accuracy of this story. Continue.,5
1,balor4,Balor:HAHAHA! I'm laughing because what you said is painful! Painful because you don't have something that is awesome! HA! Good stuff.,6
1,bgSide2,Boethius:Yes sir! Their insolence will come to an end. We will fall on them like a thing with high mass falling on a thing with very little structural integrity!!!,8
1,bgSide4.1,Boethius:It's like when you say something in a cave and the cave echoes it back. You could say that cave is 'metaphoring' you with a simile.,11
1,bgSide1,Boethius:Welcome sir. I have scouted the town of Heahill as you requested.,7
1,balor1,Balor:Did someone say powerfully pedantic?,1
1,drox2,Drox:An astute summary. I wonder how you never picked up on the magic thing before.,14
1,grey1,Dark Hood:The town of Heahill. It's people are weak and overwhelmed with distraction...We will fall on them like a bird on its prey.,15
1,grey2,Dark Hood:They will be like a flower that is so mesmerized by the feeding hummingbird that it cannot move for fear that it will disrupt perfection.,16
1,grey3,Dark Hood:Are you familiar with the concept of a simile?,17
1,grey4,Dark Hood:You just...never mind...continue scouting...from here.,18
1,grey5,"Dark Hood:Actually it is, but he's really only gotten things started. Allow me.",19
1,grey5.1,Dark Hood:Fuge hiuuxa y'est gei,20
1,grey6,Dark Hood:The mother as well? Cute. I'm taking the child...where is the child?,21
1,grey7,"You know me?? Interesting. No matter, if you are as powerful as you are pedantic then I've stumbled on true potential.",22
1,grey8,"Dark Hood:Arrogance, how common. But three adepts in the same household, that's beyond coincidence. The father seems bewildered though, is he without powers? Improbable...",23
1,grey9,Dark Hood:Improbable...I detest surprises. I'll be back for the boy when the time is right.,24
1,lucca1,Lucca:....,25
1,lucca2,Lucca:Buwi adayahee fiece iweb qaei.,26
1,Mallurian:mallurian18,"Seriously, nothing man...",27
1,mallurian1,Mallurian:He's here. *Click anywhere on the screen or press spacebar to progress dialog*,28
1,mallurian10,"Mallurian:That's what the cleric said too. Anyway, he had left me a note with only a few words on it. His dying words, which are of course well known to be the most true words one says, were:",29
1,mallurian10.1,"Mallurian:'The water lillies are the lyingest of all flowers.' Deep stuff. Anyway, what were you saying?",30
1,mallurian11,Mallurian:He's a pragmatic.,31
1,mallurian12,"Mallurian:So before, he was talking about himself.",32
1,mallurian13,Mallurian:I think...I think he doesn't appreciate waiting.,33
1,mallurian14,Mallurian:Sorry! I'm nervous and I mean who refers to themselves in the third person? That shouldn't even be a thing.,34
1,mallurian15,Mallurian:He struggles with words.,35
1,mallurian16,"Mallurian:Sen how did you just? Where is? Drox, is that you over there? Where the heck did you come from?",36
1,mallurian17,"Mallurian:Honestly I am as surprised as you. I'm kind of just taking it all in. ?I mean, wow.",37
1,mallurian19,"Mallurian:I also hate surprises, but lack the abiltiy to dematerialize. It takes a lot of the weight out of the announcement.",38
1,mallurian19.05,"Mallurian:So the prag guy looking for magic, something that is considered gone from the realm, comes by and not only does he find it but he finds...a lot.",39
1,mallurian19.1,"Mallurian:Then the hooded guy materializes and tries to take our son, I guess cause of the magic thing?",40
1,mallurian2,Mallurian:ok...,41
1,mallurian20,Mallurian:We see what we want to see I guess. This is overwhelming... whatever... wish I had magic.,42
1,mallurian3,Mallurian:so,43
1,mallurian4,Mallurian:is,44
1,mallurian5,Mallurian:now?,45
1,mallurian6,"Mallurian:So,if I'm supposed to quit being so literal is a couple of minutes actually an hour or?",46
1,mallurian7,"Mallurian:Wow,that was awesome.",47
1,mallurian7.1,"Mallurian:Wait,what do you mean 'none of it's ever going to happen'? I don't have any say in the thing?",48
1,mallurian8,"Mallurian:That's pretty wild. I guess that closes that issue. Real quick though, wanted to tell you a fully unrelated story. Not sure if you knew, but my father was a powerful florist.",49
1,mallurian9,"Mallurian:Well, he did flowering for years. Like a ton of years. Unfortunately, in his later years the flowering business got pretty tough.",50
1,mallurian9.1,Mallurian:He was killed in a freak flower accident murder. The sick bastards left half cut red flowers on his pillow as a message.,51
1,prag1,Prag:The pragmatics do not appreciate waiting.,52
1,prag2,"Prag:No, that's alright. Call the child in now please.",53
1,prag3,Prag:So I'll place the artifact on the table and we'll see if it reacts. I've never actually seen one do anything and I've done about a thousand of these.,54
1,prag4,"Prag:Some people have said they have seen some cause it to emit a small luminescence, but I suspect that is wishful thinking. Magic is dead, if it ever existed at all.",55
1,prag5,Prag:Hello there boy. Will you play a quick game with me?,56
1,prag6,Prag:Does he not talk?,57
1,prag7,"Prag:Whatever, I have 10 more of these to do this morning.",58
1,prag8,Prag:As usual...nothing. I'll be on my way.,59
1,prag9,Prag:What in the...that's not possible.,60
1,senenle1,Sen:Ok...I'm coming in. Just give me another second.,61
1,senenle10,"Sen:If anyone is listening out there,please help us keep our secret. Also,while I have you,why do they sell potion bottles in sets of 6 but they only sell you enough potion to fill 4?",62
1,senenle11,"Sen:Better get to the house. Only building in town, other than the church, with a stain glass window. Classin it up as usual.",63
1,senenle12,Sen:I figured.,64
1,senenle13,Sen:I know.,65
1,senenle14,Sen:I KNOW.,66
1,senenle15,Sen:Sorry about that. I wanted to give you time to settle in? Can I get you some tea?,67
1,senenle16,Sen:Of course.,68
1,senenle17,"Sen:Sweetheart, come in here. ? So what exactly are you going to do?",69
1,senenle18,Sen:Yeah that's pretty accurate...Sorry.,70
1,senenle2,Sen:Quit being so literal and give me a couple minutes!,71
1,senenle3,Sen:JUST GO!,72
1,senenle4,"Sen:What a goof,my goof,but definitely a goof. Same as it was 8 years ago... today!? I remember when we first started toying with the idea.",73
1,senenle5,"Sen:So,that's my best bride impersonation. Was fun to do that,even though none of this is going to happen of course.",74
1,senenle6,Sen:I went to the temple last night and prayed over the waters. As I was praying the water lillies moved into an odd formation.,75
1,senenle7,Sen:As I looked closer I saw they had spelled out 'he is too weird'.,76
1,senenle7.1,"Sen:While I am not incredibly supersitious, some signs just have to be heeded.",77
1,senenle8,"Sen:Powerful. Uncommon adjective for a florist. I'll allow it, go on. Just keep in mind I've met him like 6 times.",78
1,senenle9,"Sen:Wait, cut roses would be a pretty standard condolence. I'm pretty sure it was just a standard flower 'sorry for your loss' kind of thing.",79
1,senenleSide1,"err, wrong house. I guess.",80
1,senenleSide2,Third times a charm. Hehe,81
1,senenleSide3,"Ok, this is getting embarrassing...",82
1,senenleSide4,"Ugh, better keep looking.",83
1,senenleSide51,If Mal were here he'd tell you that's not the proper use of literally. He literally would.,84
1,senDontLeaveTown,Riveting stuff. I'd ask you more about it but... I'm afraid you'll answer,85
1,blackSmith1,"Blacksmith:Can I interest you in Iron Armor? 100G! Or Gold Armor? 1000G! Or, perhaps, DIAMOND ARMOR!! 100000G!!",86
1,senenleBlackSmith1,Sen:You seem to have an exponential thing going on with your pricing scheme. Don't you think you should narrow in on a single demographic?,87
1,blackSmith2,Blacksmith:What... do you mean?,88
1,senenleBlackSmith2,Sen:You have 3 items for sale each of which appeal to an entirely different group of customers. I mean if you get lucky enough to sell some Iron Armor it's extremely unlikely that same person would buy an item 10x its price... or 1000x its price.,89
1,blackSmith3,"Blacksmith:All these years... I thought it was my personality. I tempered armor and swords, but never... my soul.",90
1,senenleBlackSmith3,Sen: I just meant you should maybe change prices. Soul tempering is good too though.,91
2,Mal1,Mallurian: Sen... I thought you were going to stop reading? I'm trying to sleep.,1
2,Sen1,"Sen: I did, like 2 hours ago...",2
2,Mal2,Mallurian: Then turn off the candelabra already.,3
2,Sen2,"Sen: The candelabra?? What? Wait, I'm glowing... Not again...",4
2,Mal3,Mallurian: What? Snowing? That's not what I'm saying. Just please don't leave the candelabra burning again.,5
2,Sen3,"Sen: Right, hahaha. I'm gonna step outside and get some air. Sorry, honey, about the lamp. Definitely NOT sorry for a mystical glow that signifies the presence of potent latent magical powers. Forgive me... for the candelabra.",6
2,Mal4,"Mallurian: Woof, man, third time now. Yes, clearly nothing is going on but the candelabra. Please put it out.",7
2,Sen4,"Sen: Right right, out with you.. Er.. labra thing!",8
2,Sen5,Sen: I can't keep hiding this from him... he's going to figure out.,9
2,Mal5,Mallurian: zzzz MEAT SANDWICH zzzz,10
2,Sen6,"Sen: Well..even if he DOESN'T figure it out, I need to talk to him. I need to get some answers. Need to go see Sage Ralph at the church.",11
2,Mal6,Mallurian: Wait...we don't even have a candelabra. I don't even think I've ever seen a candelabra.,12
2,Mal7,Mallurian: Hmm...Better sleep on this.,13
2,Sen7,Sen: I guess I should talk to him... so nervous.,14
2,Sen8,"Sen: Sage Ralph, may I trouble your mind? There's something that's been really bothering me. I think I'm finally ready to talk about it...",15
2,Ralph1,Sage Ralph: Yes my dear Sen. I believe I have foreseen this. You have come to speak to me about your new... abilities. You wish to hear the great tale of the past. The legend of magic.,16
2,Sen9,Sen: Actually I wanted to ask... what's the deal with 'Ralph'? It's not really a very Sage-y name. Why not Merlin or Gandalf or Wizrobingston?,17
2,Ralph2,"Sage Ralph: Well, Sen, my parents chose my name, ok? I chose to be a sage. Hence, Sage Ralph.  It's not alchemy, Sen; parents name children.",18
2,Ralph3,"Sage Ralph: I bet you think I'm going to say 'no I'm not telling it now'. But, nope, in my old age I have forsaken the shackles of shame. And so it begins...",19
2,Man11,"Soldier 1:You agreed you'd be the one to do it. I was all for coming along and getting you to this point, but I have no interest in going up to that thing. I mean dragon statues AND pulsing red BLOOD ORBS?",20
2,Man21,"Soldier 2: I know what I said and it's not a matter of fear. Arcane matters require some element of prudence, you know?  I mean, no one really knows how magic came to exist.  Tinkering with it isn't like smithing a blade, you oaf.",21
2,Man31,Soldier 3:All I know is that he's right.. you said you're doing it... I'm not going to talk to that... thing again.,22
2,Man22,Soldier 2:Again? You never really proved... never mind. I'm going already.,23
2,Man32,"Soldier 3: Good. And I did too talk to it, before, and it was super brave.  I would show you right now, but I'm still pretty tired from how brave I was...",24
2,gbg1,Dark Hood:Hi!,25
2,Man23,"Soldier 2:Well, that was, unexpected.",26
2,gbg2,"Dark Hood:: You didn't think I'd say hello? You think I'm so rude? Was it the lightning? Not all lightning users are rude, you know.",27
2,Man24,"Soldier 2:No no, never mind. I heard that you could make us more powerful... than the others. Make us the greatest mages in the world.",28
2,gbg3,"Dark Hood: Yes... you realize how open ended that promise is right? I mean, I'm obviously going to just drain the power from everyone else to accomplish that.",29
2,Man25,"Soldier 2:What??! No, you wouldn't dare.",30
2,gbg4,"Dark Hood: Hahahaha. How cute.  I can feel your lie, your false outrage; it warms me.  You did know and you don't even care. I can't tell if I like that more or less.  You have the artifact?",31
2,Man26,Soldier 2: Yes. But wait...,32
2,gbg5,"Dark Hood: No... no more waiting. Destiny is a matter of choice, not a thing to be waited for, and you already took the fork. Now it's time to eat.",33
2,Ralph4,"Sage Ralph:  So you see child, they preferred to release an unspeakable evil upon the world; one which drained it of its wonder, just so they could have something they could control and lord over others.",34
2,Sen10,"Sen:Ralph... I mean, Sage Ralph. I'm sorry, I'm stressed of late. Please tell me about the legend of magic, seriously.",35
2,Ralph5,Sage Ralph: don't yet know child. I don't yet know.,36
2,Sen11,Sen: I see. But... what's happening now? Why are we changing?,37
2,SenSide1,"Sen:said not to take my promiscuous red shoes off the carpet. While I disagree with his shoe assessment, I will honor his request.",38
2,SenSide2,Sen:The church is straight east of here if I follow the road. I could walk around a bit. Not like it will be hard to find anything.,39
2,Sen12,Sen:Glow is gone again. Figures. I guess I could just go back home...ugh. No I can't. Gotta see if he knows anything.,40
2,Sen13,"Sen:I can't leave, I have to see what Sage Ralph Knows.SenSide3",41
2,SenSide3,Sen:Better not go there. Need to get to the church.,42
2,greenLadyMidTown1,"Lady:Yes, I am still out here at night time.",43
2,faceUpHoodedGuy1,"Hooded Guy:You seriously walk up to strangers in hoods and talk to them in the middle of the night? You are either really dumb or really powerful. Wait, you are glowing. The latter just tripled in probability.",44
2,greenWarriorDude1,"Doe eyed warrior:Did I ever tell you what I think about night time? Like, night is just dayless day, ya know? Oh, you're married? Never mind then",45
2,Sen14,Sen: Very poignant repetition there. Very sagely.,46
2,SenSide4,Sen: Whoa… Weird. I guess the glow is back. Almost like it knew I needed it again.,47
2,Ralph6,Sage Ralph: I went to sage school you know? They respected me there.,48
3,Cressa1,Cressa: Hey Lucca. It's me Cressa.,1
3,Cressa2,Cressa: My dad said I shouldn't really hang around you. Do you think I should hang around you?,2
3,Lucca1,Lucca:hhh...,3
3,Cressa3,"Cressa: Sorry Lucca, I forgot you can't really talk. That's ok, I like to talk. My dad says most girls like to talk. He tells mom that a lot. He doesn't talk very much but he says that a lot.",4
3,Lucca2,Lucca:...,5
3,Cressa4,Cressa: I love ponds Lucca. I love how the lilly pads just float on the pond and if the frogs need to take a break the lilly pads keep on floating and help the frogs out all the while.,6
3,Cressa5,"Cressa: The frogs are kind too though. They never just sit on the lilly pads forever for no reason or make the lilly pads sew clothes to sell or make them wash their frog warts. They just rest a while with them, warts and all, and the lillipads just hold them.",7
3,Cressa6,"Cressa: Lucca, don't you see? You're my quiet lilly pad and I'm your frog. Hahaha! RIBBIT! Look at my frog warts! EWWW!",8
3,Lucca3,Lucca:Hehehee. LLLL... ligerum!,9
3,Cressa7,Cressa: LUCCA?!?! How did you do this!! You're amazing!!!,10
3,Gbg1,"Dark Hood : Yes, Lucca, you are.",11
3,Gbg2,"Dark Hood : Lucca, I need you to come with me... calmly. I'd try and take you but you might accidentally cause a serious problem. Will you come?",12
3,Gbg3,"Dark Hood : I figured. No one ever goes on the first ask do they? Not in the stories, not in real life. I'll be back in time, but first I'm going to leave you and your friend here with something that will make you wish you had come along. Remember, what I can do, I can undo... bye.",13
3,Lucca4,Lucca: ...,14
3,Lucca5,Lucca: Hmmph!,15
3,Cressa8,Cressa: mmhmm!!!,16
3,cressaDad1,Cressa's Dad: Cressa! What are you doing up here? Er... hey Lucca. Cressa what did I tell you?,17
3,cressaDad2,Cressa's Dad: Cressa? Answer me... what's happened to you?,18
3,Cressa9,Cressa: ...,19
3,cressaDad3,"Cressa's Dad: You... you did this. You're not just a freak you're a contagious freak! Curse you... CRESSA, WITH ME.",20
3,cressaDad4,Cressa's Dad: And now she can't help me sell anything in my shop or run errands. She hasn't spoken since she was with your boy at the pond.,21
3,Mallurian1,"Mallurian: I understand that, but correlation does not equal causation.",22
3,cressaDad5,Cressa's Dad: Say what?,23
3,Mallurian2,"Mallurian: Well, what I meant is. You're an idiot.",24
3,Sen1,Sen: MAL!,25
3,cressaDad6,"Cressa's Dad: You think just cause you can say words I don't understand you are better than me? Please Mal, I know what you were, what you are. And what use is Cressa to me now? She was barely useful before.",26
3,Mallurian3,Mallurian: What... use? If I were this person you so glibly insinuate I am I'd run you through; but I have the moral high ground right now and I kind of like it.,27
3,Mallurian3.5,"Mallurian: After all, usefulness is not what makes us human, what makes us better or good. Not every person, let alone a child, is meant to contribute to the Gross Kingdom Product.",28
3,cressaDad7,"Cressa's Dad: Yeah, maybe not, but those are just pretty words. You think you're so charitable, so good? Well here's some words we both know: take her. Let's see how you deal with a second silent mouth to feed.",29
3,Sen2,"Sen: Yes, a thousand times yes. Now get out of my house.",30
3,cressaDad8,Cressa's Dad: wha... you will?,31
3,Mallurian4,Mallurian: You forgot the second part of what she said. Leave the girl and get out.,32
3,Sen3,Sen: It's alright love. You are safe and welcome here.,33
3,Mallurian5,"Mallurian: Sen, you know what this means. I thought we'd be able to make it through the winter via proper means but at this rate we'll have to see what we can... acquire.",34
3,Sen4,Sen: I thought you were done with 'acquisitions'.,35
3,Mallurian6,"Mallurian: I know,and I am. But... what I'm saying is... I'm not.",36
3,Sen5,"Sen: Sigh... Lucca, I need you and Cressa to stay with Uncle Drox and Balor for a bit. Alright, Mal, to the caves we go.",37
3,Hench11,"Aviator: Lady Callous, I present you with the new recruits.",38
3,Callous1,Callous: I can see that.,39
3,Callous2,Callous: What's that on your eye?,40
3,Recruit1,"Recruit: I lost my eye in that last skirmish, but I made it out. They let me use one of your old patches to protect it.",41
3,Callous3,"Callous: Good, I'm glad you made it out. You will have to be extra careful now as you have a blind side that can leave you exposed.",42
3,Recruit2,Recruit: Callous... why?,43
3,Callous4,"Callous: Why, I taught you to parry, but you chose to faint. Now my blade is a brush and your blood is the paint.",44
3,Hench12,"Hench1: Good one Lady Callous, hold on hold on. Ok... THEY MAKE GRAB, I MAKE STAB, NOW THEIR FUTURE IS DRAB.",45
3,Callous5,"Callous: ahem, as I was saying: The male lion sleeps all day, but the hyena... her eyes light the darkness of the jungle night. Now back to it boys.",46
3,Sen6,"Sen: Mal, be careful, it's been years since you went rogue. You could pull out your back.",47
3,Mallurian7,"Mallurian: I dunno Sen, with a confidence shot in the arm of that magnitude it's bound to be a success! It doesn't matter anyway, we need this.",48
3,Sen7,"Sen: No, maybe we don't. I wasn't sure if I told you, there are other options. I may have some new... ways.",49
3,Mallurian8,Mallurian: Like what? Magic? HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Sorry.,50
3,Sen8,Sen: Well actual-,51
3,Mallurian9,"Mallurian: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, still funny, ok, listen. I need you to go around the back and lookout for me. Just watch and make sure no reinforcements are coming back.",52
3,Mallurian10,Mallurian: I'll go in and pose as one of the newer members of the group. Whenever I get a chance I'll be snatching up gold bars until I have the full 99.,53
3,Sen9,"Sen: Right, max quantity.",54
3,Mallurian11,"Mallurian: Right, remember the time you tried to buy another healing potion when you had 99 already?",55
3,Sen10,"Sen: Yeah, I should've drank one before shopping in there. Head wasn't on right.",56
3,Mallurian12,"Mallurian: Alright, enough chattin', I'm off...",57
3,Sen11,Sen: I'd better get closer in case he needs my help.,58
3,Callous6,"Callous: Wait, some gold is missing, and you on the left!",59
3,Callous7,"Callous:Who are you? I don't remember you being a recruit, but you are familiar.",60
3,Mallurian13,Mallurian:Who I am is not as important as who I am not. And who I am not is an impostor who came here and stole your gold. To clarify again: I am an impostor who stole your gold... wait.,61
3,Sen12,Sen:MAL! GET OUT OF THERE ALREADY! LUMEN!,62
3,Callous8,"Callous:That was... Mallurian. My my, I was worried I would never get another chance to kill him. Maybe I'll have to become an optimist now? Heahill... that's the only town close enough...",63
3,Callous9,"Callous:Aviator, make preparations we're going on a field trip.",64
3,Sen13,Sen:Ready?,65
3,Cressa10,Cressa: ...,66
3,Lucca5,Lucca: nnnooo...,67
3,SenenleFlash1,"Mom: Lucca, remember when I said that if our rage controls us we relinquish all power to the one who provokes us?",68
3,SenenleFlash2,Mom: Also you didn't drink your green potion. It tastes just like the blue potion and you like the blue potion! You can't just drink ONE type of potion your whole life Lucca!,69
4,Mallurian1,How is it that all this time... you never told me that you could throw a fireball across a room?,1
4,Balor2,"err... Drox, I think this is about to get uncomfortable.",2
4,Senenle3,I tried! You were so thick you didn't even notice! that or you were so obsessed with whatever the shiny thing of the day was that you wouldn't stop talking.,3
4,Drox4,"I have had my shoulder blade cut by a broadsword and my shield arm mashed in, but this is about to be like that time I let Jess be my squire after we broke up.",4
4,Mallurian5,"Wow, that was like... a record. I think in the last two sentences you said the word I once and you four times you. Really owning it aren't you?",5
4,Balor6,"Oh man, I remember that. Every time she fitted you she asked at least 5 times if the codpiece was tight enough. I have a feeling it was. Hey, let's go check out the stain glass windows at the church.",6
4,Drox7,"Yeah well, let's just say it never fell off in battle. I had to get it resmithed after that. Why do you want to see those old windows, they haven't changed in 25 years?",7
4,Balor8,Yes... so let's... go... check them out. *WINK WINK*,8
4,Drox9,"Oh... check them out!! Right, we should. Definitely should.",9
4,Senenle10,I did try Mal. Every time I tried it felt weird. I mean what do I even say to explain something that is happening to me that I don't even understand myself?,10
4,Mallurian11,"Something Sen. Not articulate or well thought out, but something. All the things we could've blown up together. Should've said something.",11
4,Senenle12,I hardly see how saying the word 'something' would have helped.,12
4,Mallurian13,What?,13
4,Senenle14,C'mon. You can make stupid jokes about words and I can't?,14
4,Mallurian15,Heh... I did kind of feel like it was my thing. I'm still pissed though.,15
4,Mallurian16,"I mean, what do we do now? Just keep on keeping on? Who was that dude with the hood? Is there any other secret information you have about that that you should avail me of?",16
4,Senenle17,"Avail? You're such an ass. No, I don't; but he was after Lucca. I think we need to get out of town and send Lucca away with the Sage. He knows how to get him to a safe place. Then we need to figure out what's going on somehow.",17
4,Mallurian18,"Get out of town and send him away?! You must think I'm an ass cause that's a plan only an ass would agree with... No, we stay here and buckle down. We'll put some feelers out, but home is safe.",18
4,Senenle19,"Oh surprise, Mal wants to do the plan that requires the smallest amount of change possible. You're as stubborn as an ass on top of it.",19
4,Mallurian20,HP and MP! Enough with the (admittedly fantastic) donkey analogies already! I'm out of here... need some peace.,20
4,Senenle21,Mal...,21
4,Senenle22,Sigh...,22
4,Senenle23,"Toy on Floor: Lucca's blanket. I know these are just things, but they feel like so much more. Normalcy? Whatever it is, have to leave it behind.",23
4,Senenle24,How... why?,24
4,Hench25,Lady Callous how are we going to put out the fire if they give us Mal and the gold?,25
4,Callous26,I said I'd keep burning more things if they don't bring them to me. That which is already aflame is simply the cost of doing business with us.,26
4,Hench27,"Yes... I understand. It's just, some of the houses have children inside. Callous:...",27
4,Hench28,My lady...? I can't see how they merit.,28
4,Callous29,"Help the children out, don't be seen...",29
4,Hench30,Done,30
4,Hench 31,disappears,31
4,Callous32,Sigh.. that soft patch is gonna get me killed.,32
4,Callous33,BRING ME MALLURIAN.,33
4,Mallurian34,What... Sen...,34
4,Mallurian35,Sen! You were right! Let's get out of here!,35
4,Senenle36,"Ah, music to my ears, and all it took was mass arson.",36
4,Mallurian37,"Quick, over here, help me pull this board up.",37
4,Mallurian38,Get inside!,38
4,Senenle39,Sage Ralph!,39
4,Mallurian40,Bros!,40
4,Balor41,"Yup, we're all here in the place we agreed to go in case of an emergency... during an emergency. Admittedly a lot of people still don't do that but... hey!",41
4,Senenle42,"Sage... I need to ask you a favor. I need you to take Lucca and Cressa hide them away somewhere safe. At least until we find some answers as to what's going on and why... well, everything.",42
4,Drox43,I'll take Balor and head to Anwick. It's a long ways but the Paladins will certainly have heard something. I still have friends there.,43
4,Balor44,What do you mean 'take' Balor?,44
4,Mallurian45,"We'll go to Kamaryen. Steve will still be there, I imagine he'll have read or heard something on the matter.",45
